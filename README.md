Pi Framework
====================

This framework is still in development phase, don't use it on a real world app as the API may change too much. Check branch dev

Pi is a Hacklang framework to developer micro services.

When i first started to develop this framework i knew my knowledgs on PHP were far way from C#, so eventually i learned the costs of memory.

Now i'm refactoring it in order to act as a chassis framework. Pi on his core handle the web servers requests but i see it as a development only.

To produce the services i'm implementing providers to use others frameworks like React and Laravel integrating the Pi Services.
